The Used cars or Second-hand cars market has been at a rise in recent decade. People want good cars, branded cars or luxury cars depending on their purpose but owning a new car is not easy. There are some drawbacks of buying a new car like huge waiting periods, unsure of the performance and problems with individual unit, costing of maintenance etc. In recent years we have seen that a maintained car can be used even after 2 or say 5 years and it runs smoothly.
   New drivers also prefer mastering the driving skills on a second hand car so that the risk of a bigger loss while driving can be minimised. Even for a person who wanted to seel his car because of certain reasons like relocation, cash needs, or any other reasons, finding the buyer was very difficult and so was getting the right price.
We are seeing firms which have specialised in the purchase and sell of used cars and are seeing a significant increase in customers. One of the biggest challenges of these firms is to determine the right price of the used car which could depend on a lot of factors. In this Project, we would look into some basic insights from the data and also try to create a prediction model for a used car.
